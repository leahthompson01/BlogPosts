# Why you cannot divide by 0

This is something you might have encountered while in a math class, or even in an error message in your code. This might be something that you’ve been told, but you never really understand why. And if you try to google it, you’ll come up with tons of research papers on it, but almost none in basic terms. In this post, I’m going to explain why you cannot divide by 0 in simple terms that you can understand..

    All that you’re expected to know for this is multiplication and division.

Math is built on properties and theorems, which are like a set of rules and guidelines. One of the rules for division states that to be able to divide by a number, there has to exist a different number, where if you multiply the two numbers you end up with 1.

For example, to be able to divide by 2, there needs to be a number that multiplies with 2 to equal 1. In this case, that number would be ½.

    Since 2 * ½ = 1

This is called a multiplicative inverse, and for the sake of this article we are going to accept this as a truth without going into any more detail.

> Multiplicative Inverse: A number which when multiplied by x, which is another number, equals 1.

To relate this back to our original topic, why you can’t divide by zero, we’ll do a little algebra.

We know now that if we were able to divide by 0, then 0 must have a multiplicative inverse. That means we would have an x, where

    0 * x = 1

But we also know that 0 times any number equals 0, so we know for a number z, that

    0 * z = 0

> Note: The \* symbol in the equations above represents multiplication

Going back to our original equation `0 * x = 1`, that means that 0 \* x would have to equal 0, and we’d end up with 0 = 1 which is not true.

This is why anytime you try to divide by 0, you will get an error or see that the answer is undefined!
